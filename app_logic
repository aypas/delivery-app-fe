auth:
jwt data will be kept in cookies, upon succesful login, request will be sent to api/auth/user for user data which will also be kept in cookies
user data contains name, perms and node(s) to which the user belongs

application core:
view permissions depend on permissions of api/auth/user response
app will set one node's pk as main
all subsequent requests for orders, partners and users will be with with the main pk

hence, nodes should be kept in cookies as well...
